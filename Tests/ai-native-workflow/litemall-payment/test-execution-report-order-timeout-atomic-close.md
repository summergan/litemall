# Final Test Report：未支付订单超时关闭资源一致性

## Workflow Run

- `mode`: `feature_delivery`
- `feature_id`: `MALL-ORD-TIMEOUT-001`
- `execution_date`: `2026-08-18`
- `strategy_status`: `targeted-release-evidence-complete`
- `production_code_changed`: yes
- `new_executable_tests_added`: yes
- `overall_status`: **implemented and verified with residual P1 risks**

## Implementation Delivered

1. Added `OrderTimeoutCompensationService` as the Spring transaction boundary.
2. Changed `OrderUnpaidTask` to delegate to that service; the raw scheduler
   object no longer owns the database transaction.
3. Added rollback on stock/coupon failure, optimistic-lock safe skip, and task
   success/skip/failure logs with order context.
4. Added unit and Testcontainers MySQL integration coverage, including the
   missing `litemall_order_goods` test fixture.

## Executed Commands

| scope | command | result | evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| focused UT | `mvn -q -f Tests/backend/pom.xml -Dtest=OrderTimeoutCompensationServiceUnitTest,OrderUnpaidTaskUnitTest test` | PASS | 7 timeout-related unit cases |
| full workflow | `./Tests/scripts/run-layered-tests.sh all` | PASS | scripts, Backend UT, Contract, Frontend UT/IT, Backend IT, E2E |
| workflow validation | `ruby AI Native/skills/test-agent-workflow/scripts/validate-workflow.rb` | PASS | `indexed_paths=27`, `skills=19` |

The full `all` lane also generated backend and frontend coverage artifacts.
Backend IT used Testcontainers against the Colima Docker socket.

## Layer Results

| layer | new tests | existing regression | result |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| Backend UT | **7** | existing regression passed | PASS |
| Backend IT | **3** | **5** existing regression tests passed | PASS, 8 total |
| Contract | 0 | existing regression passed | PASS |
| Frontend UT | 0 | existing regression 4/4 | PASS |
| Frontend IT | 0 | existing regression 15/15 | PASS |
| E2E | 0 | existing regression 4/4 | PASS |
| Runner / quality gates | 0 | existing checks passed | PASS |

### Newly Added Executable Tests

- Backend UT: `OrderTimeoutCompensationServiceUnitTest` — **5 tests**
- Backend UT: `OrderUnpaidTaskUnitTest` — **2 tests**
- Backend IT: `OrderTimeoutConsistencyIT` — **3 tests**

The table intentionally keeps new tests and existing regression evidence
separate. The existing regression column is not itself a claim that every test
is directly impacted by this internal timeout change.

## Acceptance Evidence

| AC | result | evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AC01 | PASS | order becomes `103`, product stock `5 → 7`, coupon becomes usable |
| AC02 | PASS | terminal order is skipped; repeated run has no new side effect |
| AC03 | PASS | missing product causes failure; order remains `101`, stock/coupon unchanged |
| AC04 | PASS | coupon update failure propagates instead of being silently accepted |
| AC05 | PASS | second execution does not add stock or release coupon again |
| AC06 | PARTIAL | optimistic-lock loss is a safe no-op; real concurrent IT is deferred |
| AC07 | PARTIAL | task logs order id/result/failure cause; structured log assertion is deferred |

## Evidence Artifacts

- `Tests/backend/target/surefire-reports/`
- `Tests/backend/target/failsafe-reports/`
- `Tests/backend/target/site/jacoco/index.html`
- `Tests/frontend/coverage/index.html`
- `litemall/Tests/ai-native-workflow/litemall-payment/test-case-design-order-timeout-atomic-close.md`
- `litemall/Tests/ai-native-workflow/litemall-payment/test-strategy-order-timeout-atomic-close.md`

## Final Decision

Approve the implemented atomic rollback and repeat-execution scope for release
review. Do not claim real multi-thread concurrency or structured log collection
as fully proven until the two P1 follow-up cases are added.
